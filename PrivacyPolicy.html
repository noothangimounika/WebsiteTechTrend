                When you submit information such as a comment or sign up for the newsletter, its metadata is retained until (if) you tell us to remove it. We <br>
                use this data so that we can recognize you and approve your comments automatically instead of holding them for moderation.

            <p>
                We use the SSL/HTTPS protocol throughout our site. This encrypts our user communications with the servers so that personally identifiable <br>
                information is not captured/hijacked by third parties without authorization. In case of a data breach, system administrators will immediately <br>
                take all needed steps to ensure system integrity, will contact affected users and will attempt to reset passwords if needed.
            </p>

            <h2 style="margin-bottom: 50px;">9. Your Data Rights</h2>
            <h2>General Rights</h2>

                including any additional data you have provided to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also request that we erase any of the personal data we have stored. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for <br>
                administrative, legal, or security purposes. In short, we cannot erase data that is vital to you being an active customer (i.e. basic account <br>

           <h2>11. Release of Your Data for Legal Purposes </h2>
           <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
            At times it may become necessary or desirable to Techtrend Group, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request <br>
            from a government agency or a private litigant. You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good <br>
            faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a <br>
            subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may <br>
            attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also proactively report you, and release your information to, <br>
            third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. <br>
            You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a request from law enforcement <br>
            agencies or private litigants.
